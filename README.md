# TouristProblem
A travel planner that lets you pick what events/places you want to see during a trip and then optimizes the best order to visit them in based on distance using the Traveling Salesman Problem algorithm.

Makes use of the [Eventbrite REST API](https://www.eventbrite.com/developer/v3/) and [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/).

More details of the TSP algorithm can be found in *Algorithms* by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, Vazirani, which provided the inspiration behind this app. 

**Stack**: [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [Node](https://github.com/nodejs/node), [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
